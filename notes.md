1. Depression
2. Anxiety
3. Perfectionism (mix of both)


Some people may think that they or someone they know are doomed to depression
because of there harsh life experiences. This is not true.

By learning more about your physical reactions, thoughts and behaviours, 
you will learn to overcome your panic attacks. The physical reactions in
anxiety and depression are different. Physical reactions associated with
depression often involve a slowing down - insomnia, lethargy, feeling tired;
where as anxiety is usually marked by a speeding up of the physical - pounding
heart, increased sweating. Avoidance is characteristic of both, you tend to
avoid doing certain things in anxiety but in depression you feel withdrawn from
life itself. Thinking (or thoughts) is quite different in the states of
depression and anxiety. Depressed thinking tends to be negative, hopeless and
self-critical. Anxious thinking is more catastrophic ("I'm having a heart
attack") and involves worry about specific future events. Anxious people,
rather than thinking of themselves in generally negative terms, as people do
when depressed, see themselves as vulnerable in a few specific situations.
