      I put ideas, my thought processes, how I think and perceive things, my
      workflows, why I like certain things and dislike others and those kind of
      things for anyone who is interested in this website.

    <h2>How to read this blog?</h2>

    If you're reading this sentence then you've pretty much got it. Good job.
    Just keep going the way you are.

    <h2>Why I think VIM is the best text editor in the face of the earth?</h2>

    Because it is the best text editor on the face of this earth.

    <h2>Neural Networks Mindset</h2>
    <p>Neural networks for me, when I was just starting out was very boring.
    This was partly because training models took a lot of time and, partly
    because I was in the wrong mindset. Neural networks are like modern day
    science experiments where nothing is certain. It is kinda like how
    scientists worked in the past. 

    Scientists in the past ran tons of experiments to come to a specific
    conclusion about something. They tried bunch of stuff, that may or may not
    have made sense. 

    This sort of workflow has pretty much banished in most fields of work.
    There is a strict protocol that one must follow to get what the achieve but
    this does not translate to neural networks.
