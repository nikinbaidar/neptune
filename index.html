      <h1>About this page</h1>

      <p>This website belongs to Nikin Baidar. Only plain HTML and CSS is used
      to create this website and it intends to violate all the modern ui/ux
        standards. This is the most out-of-place projects I have ever done and
        I intend to keep it that way, you can find some of my other projects <a
      href="https://www.github.com/nikinbaidar">here</a>.
      I have not given this website any structure nor do I have any plans of
      doing so, you just explore around and find whatever is interesting to
      you.

      <p>Fast learners are no better than slow learners. The pace at which you
      learn does not matter, what matters the most is the end result. The
      important thing is to stay consistent and to not give up.</p>
